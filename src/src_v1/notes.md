## How to run
Kindly note that this is most likely deprecated now but since the goal is to actually document how I arrived at a final framework I'm going to keep updating this to the extent that I can

To see my progress so far, create a virtual env and install the requirements then cd into `src` and execute `python testrun.py`

the main script has the core idea per unit time, but then they may not have been tested or completely integrated, the testrun script will hold the most up to date tested pieces.
